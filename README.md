# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub Profile

I'm a dedicated **Software Engineer** specializing in **React**, **Next.js**, **Node.js**, and **AWS**. I build scalable, performant web applications with modern frameworks and deploy them with production grade infrastructure.

---

## 💻 What I'm Working On

One of my key projects is [**Bytecap.io**](https://bytecap.io), a **SaaS platform** built with **Next.js**, **React**, and **AWS**. Bytecap is actively used by real users and designed to scale seamlessly as traffic grows.

Building Bytecap has sharpened my skills in:

- ⚡ Building scalable, high performance applications using **Next.js** for the frontend and **Node.js** on the backend
- 🏗️ Architecting full stack solutions that scale using **AWS services** like **Lambda**, **S3**, **CloudFront**, and **DynamoDB**
- 🔍 Monitoring and debugging production environments with **real users** to ensure reliability and a seamless experience

**Backend & Cloud**

## 🌍 A Bit About Me

Outside of engineering, I’m passionate about **Thai boxing** 🥊 and **traveling** ✈️ — two pursuits that help keep me grounded, curious, and constantly learning. I find that a balanced life enhances my creativity and problem-solving as a developer.
